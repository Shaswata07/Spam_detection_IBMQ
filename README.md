# Spam_detection_IBMQ
This is a simple algorithm for spam detection. The best thing about it is that it works on a QUANTUM COMPUTER. Hell yes. We used this code to train our data set and successfully implemented on IBM X2 simulator. Further work is carried on to implement it on a real quantum computer at IBM.
